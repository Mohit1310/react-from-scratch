  <h3>Why is React fast?</h3>
  <p>It has virtual dom but that is just a small part and it useds bundles like parcel which then has more other features like</p>
  <p>Other key features are:-</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Efficient updates</li>
    <li>Reconcilation</li>
    <li>Component-based Architecture</li>
    <li>Unidirectional data flow</li>
    <li>ShouldComponentUpdate</li>
    <li>Fiber Architecture</li>
    <li>Code splitting</li>
    <li>Virtualization techniques</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What is 'NPM'?</h3>
  <p>NPM has no official full form but it handles all the packages created by users i.e a (node package manager). It is
    an open source 'project' we can say where it has a huge collection of packages which anyone can use, update or
    publish</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>What is 'Parcel/Webpack/Vite'? Why do we need it?</h3>
  <p>In short these are all bundles used for development of web app, optimization of code, assets and other resources
    which lead to better performance of the app.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>What is '.parcel-cache'?</h3>
  <p>It is a cache folder created by Parcel bundler. When we run parcel it budles all the code and the assets to improve
    the code performance. These all are stored in <b>.parcel-cache</b> folder. When you run the project first time it is
    created and next time when you run the project again it wil run faster than last time because everything is stored
    in cache folder. <br><br> <b>.parcel-cache</b> is useful because</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Faster builds</li>
    <li>Reduced Resource usage</li>
    <li>Efficient Development Workflow</li>
  </ol>
  <hr>
  <h3>What is 'npx'?</h3>
  <p><b>npx</b> is a executing tool, in npx 'x' is for execution. It comes with Node/npm. It stands for 'Node Package
    Runner'. Like for creating a react app we use <b>npx create-react-app my-app</b> or to run a react app that uses
    parcel bundler we use <b>npx parcel index.html</b>.</p>

      <tr>
        <td><code>devDependencies</code></td>
        <td>Development Dependencies</td>
        <td>Used during development, testing, and building, but not needed for production.</td>

  <h3>What is Tree Shaking?</h3>
  <p>Simply means removal of <b>dead/unused code</b>.</p>
  <p>Here's how tree shaking works</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Static Analysis</li>
    <li>Unused code detection</li>
    <li>Code removal</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Benifits of Tree Shaking</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Smaller Bundle Size</li>
    <li>Efficient Resource Usage</li>
    <li>Optimized for Production</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>What is Hot Module Replacement?</h3>
  <p>It is a technique used in modern web development to enable real time updates for the application without requiring
    a full page reload or manual refresh</p>
  <p>Working of HMR</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Detection of changes</li>
    <li>Selective Replacement</li>
    <li>Preservation of state</li>
    <li>Fast Feedback loop</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>HMR - Hot Module Replacement</li>
    <li>File Watcher algorithm - written C++</li>
    <li>BUNDLING</li>
    <li>MINIFY</li>
    <li>Cleaning our Code</li>
  </ol>
  <hr>
  <h3>What is <b><code>'.gitignore'</code></b>? What should we add and not add into it</h3>
  <p>It is a file in which we can specify the files that we don't want to see in our repo but can be viewed on our local
    machine.</p>
  <b>- What to add?</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Generated files</li>
    <li>Dependencies</li>
    <li>Temporary files</li>
    <li>User-specific files</li>
    <li>Sensitive information (.env, etc)</li>
  </ol>
  <b>- What not to add?</b>
  <ol>
    <li>Source code</li>
    <li>Configuration files</li>
    <li>Documentation</li>
    <li>Assets and resources</li>
    <li>Files required for testing</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In general, the goal of <code>.gitignore</code> is to keep your repository clean, focused, and free from
    unnecessary clutter. By excluding files that are not crucial for the development process, you can maintain a more
    organized and efficient version control system.</p>

  <h3>What is the difference between <code>package.json</code> and <code>package-lock.json</code></h3>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>File</th>
        <th>Purpose</th>
        <th>Usage</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>package.json</code></td>
        <td>Dependency Declaration</td>
        <td>Specifies the project's dependencies, scripts, metadata, and configuration.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>package-lock.json</code></td>
        <td>Dependency Locking</td>
        <td>Locks dependency versions and resolves them to ensure consistent installs.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>In summary, while both <code>package.json</code> and <code>package-lock.json</code> are integral parts of Node.js
    projects managed with npm, they serve different purposes. The <code>package.json</code> file defines project
    metadata, scripts, and dependencies, while the <code>package-lock.json</code> file ensures that dependency versions
    are locked and consistent across different installations.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Why should I not modify <code>package-lock.json</code>?</h3>
  <p>Following are the reasons for not to modify the file</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dependency consistency</li>
    <li>Automatic generation</li>
    <li>Version conflicts</li>
    <li>Collaboration Issues</li>
    <li>Upgrades and installs</li>
    <li>Potential Data loss</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3>What is <code>node_modules</code> ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?</h3>
  <p>The file directory is a default in Node js projects where the dependencies required by the project are installed.
    This code actually contains the actual code of packages you've specified as dependencies in your
    <code><b>package.json</b></code> file. Because of this the directory size is very huge and it not a good Idea to
    push that on git.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>What is the <code><b>dist</b></code> folder?</h3>
  <p>It is short for <code>distribution</code> or <code>output</code>. It is created when you are running react using
    the parcel bundle, in here all your code is minified when you run the code using <code>npx parcel index.html</code>
    for development environment.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>What is <code>browserlists</code>?</h3>
  <p>It is a configuration tool and library used to specify which browsers and their versions your web application
    should support. Browserslist is commonly used in web development, especially when setting up autoprefixing for CSS
    and making decisions about which browser versions to target for compatibility.
    <br>
    Browserslist allows you to define a list of browsers that your project needs to support. This list can be used by
    various tools and libraries to determine how to handle CSS and JavaScript transformations to ensure compatibility
    with the specified browsers.
  </p>
  <p>Here's an example of how Browserslist is typically used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>In <code>package.json</code></b></li>
    <li><code>"browserslist": "> 1%, last 2 versions"</code> </li>
  </ul>
