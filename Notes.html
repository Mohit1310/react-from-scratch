    <h3>What is Emmet?</h3>
    <p>
        Just a shortcut to write elements in html eg.
        <strong>"div>div>h1"</strong>
        will create a div inside another div inside it h1 tag will create

    <h3>Difference between a Library and Framework?</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            A library is like a toolbox filled with various tools. Each tool has a
            specific function, like a hammer, a screwdriver, or a wrench. When you
            want to build something, you can take out the tools you need from the
            toolbox and use them individually to create your project. You have the
            freedom to choose which tools to use and how to use them, allowing you
            to build things your own way.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, a framework is like a blueprint or a set of
            guidelines for building something specific, like a house. It provides
            you with a structured plan, telling you what materials to use, where to
            put each part, and how to assemble everything together. It's like
            following a step-by-step instruction manual that ensures all the pieces
            fit together perfectly. The framework helps you build the project more
            efficiently and ensures consistency, but it might limit some of your
            creative freedom compared to using a toolbox full of various tools.
        </p>

    <h3>What is CDN and why do we use it?</h3>
    <p>
        It is a content delivery network. We use it for faster load times,
        scalability, cost savings, etc. It is a powerful tool to accelerate
        website loading times and experience
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Why React is known as React?</h3>
    <p>
        React is known as "React" because its name comes from its core concept of
        "reacting" to changes in data and updating the user interface accordingly.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>What is crossorigin in script tag?</h3>
    <p>
        The `crossorigin` attribute in the script tag allows loading scripts from
        different domains securely. It prevents browser security issues when
        fetching scripts from external sources by enforcing proper permissions.

    <h3>Why is React fast?</h3>
    <p>It has virtual dom but that is just a small part and it useds bundles like parcel which then has more other
        features like</p>
    <p>Other key features are:-</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Efficient updates</li>
        <li>Reconcilation</li>
        <li>Component-based Architecture</li>

    <h3>What is 'NPM'?</h3>
    <p>NPM has no official full form but it handles all the packages created by users i.e a (node package manager). It
        is
        an open source 'project' we can say where it has a huge collection of packages which anyone can use, update or
        publish</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is 'Parcel/Webpack/Vite'? Why do we need it?</h3>
    <p>In short these are all bundles used for development of web app, optimization of code, assets and other resources
        which lead to better performance of the app.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is '.parcel-cache'?</h3>
    <p>It is a cache folder created by Parcel bundler. When we run parcel it budles all the code and the assets to
        improve
        the code performance. These all are stored in <b>.parcel-cache</b> folder. When you run the project first time
        it is
        created and next time when you run the project again it wil run faster than last time because everything is
        stored
        in cache folder. <br><br> <b>.parcel-cache</b> is useful because</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Faster builds</li>
        <li>Reduced Resource usage</li>
        <li>Efficient Development Workflow</li>

    <h3>What is 'npx'?</h3>
    <p><b>npx</b> is a executing tool, in npx 'x' is for execution. It comes with Node/npm. It stands for 'Node Package
        Runner'. Like for creating a react app we use <b>npx create-react-app my-app</b> or to run a react app that uses
        parcel bundler we use <b>npx parcel index.html</b>.</p>

    <h3>What is <b><code>'.gitignore'</code></b>? What should we add and not add into it</h3>
    <p>It is a file in which we can specify the files that we don't want to see in our repo but can be viewed on our
        local
        machine.</p>
    <b>- What to add?</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Generated files</li>
        <li>Dependencies</li>
        <li>Temporary files</li>
        <li>User-specific files</li>
        <li>Sensitive information (.env, etc)</li>
    </ol>
    <b>- What not to add?</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Source code</li>
        <li>Configuration files</li>
        <li>Documentation</li>
        <li>Assets and resources</li>
        <li>Files required for testing</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In general, the goal of <code>.gitignore</code> is to keep your repository clean, focused, and free from
        unnecessary clutter. By excluding files that are not crucial for the development process, you can maintain a
        more
        organized and efficient version control system.</p>

    <h3>What is the difference between <code>package.json</code> and <code>package-lock.json</code></h3>
    <div class="table">
        <table>

                <tr>
                    <th>File</th>
                    <th>Purpose</th>

                <tr>
                    <td><code>package.json</code></td>
                    <td>Dependency Declaration</td>
                    <td>Specifies the project's dependencies, scripts, metadata, and configuration.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>In summary, while both <code>package.json</code> and <code>package-lock.json</code> are integral parts of Node.js
        projects managed with npm, they serve different purposes. The <code>package.json</code> file defines project
        metadata, scripts, and dependencies, while the <code>package-lock.json</code> file ensures that dependency
        versions
        are locked and consistent across different installations.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Why should I not modify <code>package-lock.json</code>?</h3>
    <p>Following are the reasons for not to modify the file</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dependency consistency</li>
        <li>Automatic generation</li>
        <li>Version conflicts</li>
        <li>Collaboration Issues</li>
        <li>Upgrades and installs</li>
        <li>Potential Data loss</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is <code>node_modules</code> ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?</h3>
    <p>The file directory is a default in Node js projects where the dependencies required by the project are installed.
        This code actually contains the actual code of packages you've specified as dependencies in your
        <code><b>package.json</b></code> file. Because of this the directory size is very huge and it not a good Idea to
        push that on git.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is the <code><b>dist</b></code> folder?</h3>
    <p>It is short for <code>distribution</code> or <code>output</code>. It is created when you are running react using
        the parcel bundle, in here all your code is minified when you run the code using
        <code>npx parcel index.html</code>
        for development environment.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is <code>browserlists</code>?</h3>
    <p>
        It is a configuration tool and library used to specify which browsers and their versions your web application
        should support. Browserslist is commonly used in web development, especially when setting up autoprefixing for
        CSS
        and making decisions about which browser versions to target for compatibility.
        <br>
        Browserslist allows you to define a list of browsers that your project needs to support. This list can be used
        by
        various tools and libraries to determine how to handle CSS and JavaScript transformations to ensure
        compatibility
        with the specified browsers.
    </p>
    <p>Here's an example of how Browserslist is typically used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>In <code>package.json</code></b></li>
        <li><code>"browserslist": "> 1%, last 2 versions"</code> </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What is JSX?</h3>
    <p>Simply put <code>jsx</code> is html inside javascript, i.e. javascript XML but it is not official, instead it is
        XML-like syntax extension to EcmaScript</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Superpowers of <code>jsx</code></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Readability</b>: JSX combines HTML-like syntax with JavaScript, making it easy to understand the
            structure of
            UI
            elements and how they interact with data.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Declarative Syntax</b>: JSX allows you to declare what the UI should look like based on the current state
            of
            your
            application. It's a declarative way to describe how your UI should react to data changes.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Embedding Expressions</b>: You can embed JavaScript expressions within JSX using curly braces {}. This
            enables dynamic
            rendering and allows you to include variables, functions, and calculations directly within your UI.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Component Composition</b>: JSX supports the composition of components. You can create and nest components
            within each
            other, creating a modular and reusable architecture.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Babel Transformation</b>: JSX is not natively understood by browsers. However, tools like Babel can
            transform JSX into
            plain JavaScript that browsers can understand.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>No Additional Abstraction</b>: While JSX resembles HTML, it's not an entirely new language or template
            engine. It's a
            lightweight abstraction that gets transpiled into JavaScript, allowing you to leverage the full power of
            JavaScript.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>JSX Fragments</b>: JSX Fragments (<>...</>) allow you to group multiple elements without introducing
            extra nodes into
            the DOM, improving performance and reducing unnecessary nesting.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Custom Components</b>: With JSX, you can easily define and use your own custom components. This
            encourages a modular and
            maintainable codebase.

    </h3>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <code>{TitleComponent}</code> is for element only and not a function by element we can consider only a

    <h3>Is mandatory for React?</h3>
    <p>
        No, (JavaScript XML) is not mandatory for writing React applications, but it is highly recommended and
        widely used due to its benefits. is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within
        JavaScript, making it easier to describe and visualize the structure of your UI components. <br>While you can
        write React applications using plain JavaScript without , doing so can make your code more verbose, harder to
        read, and less intuitive. simplifies the process of defining UI elements and their interactions with data by
        providing a declarative and expressive syntax.
    </p>
    <p>Here's an example of a simple React component written with and without :</p>
    <div class="table">
        <table>
            <tr>

    <h3>Is ES6 mandatory for React?</h3>
    <p>
        ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is not mandatory for writing React applications, but it is highly recommended and widely
        used due to the modern JavaScript features and improvements it provides. React itself doesn't require you to use
        ES6, but leveraging ES6 features can significantly enhance your development experience and code quality.
    </p>
    <p>Few Reason's why ES6 is benificial</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Arrow Functions</li>
        <li>Classes</li>
        <li>Template literals</li>

    <h3>How can I write comments in <code></code>?</h3>
    <p>As we know if we use "{}" we can write an js code inside brackets we can use "//...." for single line comment and
        "{/*...*/}" for multiline comments.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is <code>&lt;React.Fragment&gt;&lt;/React.Fragment&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;</code> ?</h3>
    <p>
        Both are used to create a component that doesn't render and additional DOM element. React.Fragment is a built in
        component while <code>&lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;</code> is more concise syntax ('fragment shorthand') or empty tag. This
        is available from React 16.2, in React.fragment we can use '<b>key</b>' or other attributes but not in empty
        tag.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is Virtual DOM?</h3>
    <p>
        Virtual DOM simple means a representation of actual DOM. This is used in libraries or frameworks such as React
        for UI rendering only rendering that element or let's say a new 'div' is added to your code instead of rendering
        the whole code react only renders the new added code. This process is called <i>reconcilliation</i>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is Reconciliation in react?</h3>
    <p>
        We can also call it as <i>'Preserving and Resetting State'</i><br>
        <b>Defination: </b>The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be
        changed.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is React Fiber?</h3>
    <p>
        It is basically a new and upcoming algorithm/architecture for react's diff algorithm for more we can read <a
            href="https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Why we need keys in React?</h3>
    <p>
        The main purpose of keys is to help React differentiate and distinguish elements from each other, increasing its
        performance when diffing between the virtual and real DOM.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Can we use index as keys in React?</h3>
    <p>
        We can use them but it is not recommended and mostly we should not use them because that can cause rendering /
        re-rendering
        issue. Detailed article is <a href="https://robinpokorny.com/blog/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern/">here</a>.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is props in React?</h3>
    <p>
        props (properties) in react are simply an arguments to the function. React components use props to communicate
        with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props.
        Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including
        objects, arrays, and functions.

    <h3>What is Config Driven UI?</h3>
    <p>
        For simple terms let's take example of <a href="https://www.swiggy.com/">Swiggy</a>. On the swiggy's website we
        can see a navbar, carousel which has offers and then the body and so on. Now inside the carousel the offers are
        different for every city some may have it some may don't and the data is rendered accordingly. So if a city has
        no offers then directly the body will appear after the navbar and no carousel. This type of rendering is known
        as Config Driven UI.

    <h3>What is the importance of config.js/constants.js ?</h3>
    <p>
        <code><b>`config.js`</b></code> or <code><b>`constants.js`</b></code> files are often used in web development to
        centralize and manage configuration
        settings and constants within an application. These files play a crucial role in maintaining a clean codebase,
        improving maintainability, and making it easier to manage various aspects of your application.
    </p>
    <p>Here's the importance of using such files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Centralization</li>
        <li>Maintainability</li>

    <h3>What are React Hooks ?</h3>
    <p>
        Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 as a way to simplify and improve the development experience of writing
        components by promoting more reusable and easier-to-understand code. Hooks addresses the need for better code
        organization, reusablity, and state management in functional components. <br>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Why do we need a `useState` Hook?</h3>
    <p>
        <code><b>useState</b></code> in react is used to manage the local state with functional components. It is like a
        variable a react. The main reason is to enable functional components to have dynamic, mutable state, which is
        crucial for building interactive and data-driven user interfaces.

    <h3>What is Microservice ?</h3>
    <p>
        In a very simple way it's an approach to building software applications by breaking them down into smaller,
        loosely copupled, and independently deployable services. Each service represents a specific business capability
        and can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. These services communicate with each other over a
        well-defined APIs, often through lightweight protocols such as HTTP or messaging systems.
    </p>
    <p>Key char's of Microservices are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Independence</li>
        <li>Scalability</li>

        single codebase, and the application typically shares a single database.
    </p>

    <h3>Why do we need a useEffect Hook?</h3>
    <p>
        It is useed to manage data fetching and DOM manipulation, in functional components <br>
        <code>`useEffect`</code> is a hook to handle side effects in functional components. Side effects are actions
        that are not directly relate to rendering UI but can have an impact on the component's behavior.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is Optional Chaining?</h3>
    <p>
        It is represented by <code>`<b>?.</b>`</code> syntax in JavaScript, is a feature that allows you to safely
        access nested properties and methods of an object without the need to check if each level of the property chain
        exists. It helps prevent "TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined" errors that occur when trying to
        access properties or methods on potentially undefined or null values.
    </p>
    <p>Basic idea of optional chaining:</p>
    <code>
    <pre>
    // Without Optional Chaining
    if (object && object.property && object.property.nestedProperty) {
        // Access nestedProperty
    }
    
    // With Optional Chaining
    const value = object?.property?.nestedProperty;</pre>
    </code>
    <p>
        In the example without optional chaining we would manually need to check at each level of the property chain
        before accessing the nested property, the <code>`<b>?.</b>`</code> operator handles these checks automatically
        and returns undefined if any part of the chain is undefined or null.
    </p>
    <p>Key points about optional chaining:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Short-circuiting</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
        <li>Arrays</li>
        <li>Browser Compatibility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Eg. of optional chaining:</p>
    <code>
        <pre>
    const user = {
        id: 1,
        name: 'John',
        address: {
            city: 'New York',
            zip: '10001'
        }
    };

    const cityName = user?.address?.city; // Accesses city safely
    const zipCode = user?.address?.zip;   // Accesses zip safely
    const country = user?.address?.country; // Returns undefined (no 'country' property)</pre>
    </code>

    <h3>What is Shimmer UI?</h3>
    <p>
        Well simple put it is the skeleton of the actual code. Like when first open for eg. cdr swiggy's website
        homepage before loading all the components we a skeleton layout of actual cards or any item so we understand
        that there is going to be a card something similar here. This provide a good user experience.

    <h3>What is Conditional Rendering, explain with a code example ?</h3>
    <p>
        Conditional rendering in React refers to the practice of rendering different content or components based on
        certain conditions. It allows you to display different UI elements depending on the state of your application or
        certain user interactions. <br><br> Here's an example:
    </p>
    <code>
        <pre>
    const App = () => {
        const isLoggedIn = true; // Example: User is logged in
    
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Conditional Rendering Example&lt;/h1&gt;
            {isLoggedIn ? (
                &lt;p&gt;Welcome, User! &lt;/p&gt;
            ) : (
                &lt;p&gt;Please log in to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
            )}
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    };
    
    ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.getElementById('root'));
        </pre>
    </code>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is CORS?</h3>
    <p>
        It is a security feature implemented in web browsers to control and regulate the access to resources (such as
        fonts, images, APIs, and web services) across different origins (domains) on the internet. It prevents
        unauthorized access to resources hosted on one domain by scripts running on another domain. <br> CORS is
        particularly relevant when making requests from a web page hosted on one domain (origin) to an API or server
        hosted on a different domain. Without proper CORS configuration, web browsers would block these requests to
        prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <p>Key points about CORS:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Same-Origin Policy</li>
        <li>Cross-Origin Requests</li>
        <li>CORS Headers</li>
        <li>Preflight Requests</li>
        <li>Credentials</li>
        <li>Security</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Example of how CORS headers might be set on a server response to allow cross-origin requests:
    </p>
    <code>
        <pre>
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://www.example.com
    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT
    Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true</pre>
    </code>
    <p>
        In this example, the server indicates that requests from https://www.example.com are allowed, with certain HTTP
        methods and headers, and credentials can be included.
    </p>

    <h3>What is async and await?</h3>
    <p>
        <code>`<b>async</b>`</code> and <code>`<b>await</b>`</code> are features in JavaScript that simplify working
        with asynchronous code and Promises. They make
        asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, improving readability and manageability. The async
        keyword is used to define asynchronous functions, and the await keyword is used within async functions to pause
        execution until a Promise is resolved. <br><br>Here's an example:
    </p>
    <code>
        <pre>
    // Using Promises without async/await
    function fetchData() {
    return fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .catch(error => console.error(error));
    }

    fetchData().then(data => {
    console.log(data);
    });

    // Using async/await
    async function fetchDataAsync() {
        try {
            const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
            const data = await response.json();
            return data;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(error);
        }
    }

    (async () => {
    const data = await fetchDataAsync();
    console.log(data);
    })();</pre>
    </code>
    <p>
        In the above example, we have a function <code>`<b>fetchData</b>`</code> that returns a Promise by using the
        <code>`<b>fetch</b>`</code> API. The
        traditional way to handle the Promise is by using .then() and .catch().
        <br><br>
        The second function, <code>`<b>fetchDataAsync</b>`</code>, is an <code>`<b>async</b>`</code> function that makes
        use of the <code>`<b>await</b>`</code>
        keyword within it. With
        <code>`<b>await</b>`</code>, we can pause the execution of the function until the Promise returned by
        <code>`<b>fetch</b>`</code> resolves. This makes the asynchronous code look similar to synchronous code.
        <br><br>
        Note that to use <code>`<b>await</b>`</code>, you need to be within an <code>`<b>async</b>`</code> function,
        which is why we're wrapping the calling code in
        an immediately-invoked asynchronous function in the example.
        <br><br>
        <code>`<b>async/await</b>`</code> offers improved code readability, easier error handling (with
        <code>`<b>try</b>`/`<b>catch</b>`</code>), and a more natural flow of control when dealing with asynchronous
        operations, making it a powerful tool for managing asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like manner.
        <br><br>

    <h3>What is the use of `const json = await data.json();` in getRestaurants() in below code ?</h3>
    <code>
        <pre>
    async function getRestaurants() {
        const data = await fetch(
            "https://www.swiggy.com/dapi/..."
        );
        const json = await data.json();
        console.log("Fetched JSON:", json); // Log the fetched data
        //* Optional Chaining
        setAllRestaurants(
            json?.data?.cards[2]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants
        );
        setFilteredRestaurants(
            json?.data?.cards[2]?.card?.card?.gridElements?.infoWithStyle?.restaurants
        );
    }</pre>
    </code>
    <b>Coding term:</b>
    <p>
        In the <code>`<b>getRestaurants()</b>`</code> function,
        <code><pre>`const json = await data.json();`</pre></code> takes the response from the
        <code>`<b>fetch</b>`</code>
        request and converts it into a usable form. Think of it like receiving a package. The
        <code>`<b>fetch</b>`</code> gets the package, but you can't use it directly. <code>`<b>data.json()</b>`</code>
        opens the package and reads what's inside (converting it from a special format called JSON to something your
        code understands). The <code>`<b>await</b>`</code> makes sure we
        wait for this process to finish. Then, the converted data is stored in the <code>`<b>json</b>`</code> variable.
        This is like getting the content of the package ready to use. You can now work with the content, like showing it
        on a screen or using it to update things in your code.
    </p>
    <b>Simple term:</b>
    <p>
        Fetching data from a website is similar to ordering food. You ask for information (data), but it takes time to
        arrive. The <code>`<b>await data.json();</b>`</code> line is like unpacking the delivered meal—making the data
        usable for your code. It's waiting for the website's response, turning it into something your code understands.
        Just as you can enjoy your meal after it's ready, your code can work with the data. The
        <code>`<b>json</b>`</code> variable now has the data, and you can show it on the screen or use it to update
        things. It's like enjoying the meal you ordered!

    <h1>Day 7</h1>
    <h3>What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples.</h3>
    <p>There are 3 ways:</p>
    <h4>1. Using `<code>img</code>` Tag:</h4>
    <p>This is a standard HTML <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> tag</p>
    <code>
        <pre>
    import React from 'react';

    const App = () => {
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Using img Tag&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;img src="/path/to/image.jpg" alt="Sample" /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    };

    export default App;</pre>
    </code>
    <h4>2. Imported Images:</h4>
    <p>We can import images directly into our React components and use them as variables.</p>
    <code>
        <pre>
    import React from 'react';
    import sampleImage from './path/to/image.jpg';

    const App = () => {
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Importing Images&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;img src={sampleImage} alt="Sample" /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    };

    export default App;</pre>
    </code>
    <h4>3. Using <code>public</code> folder:</h4>
    <p>We can place our images in public folder and use them directly</p>
    <code>
        <pre>
    import React from 'react';

    const App = () => {
        return (
            &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Using public folder&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;img src="/image.jpg" alt="Sample" /&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        );
    };

    export default App;</pre>
    </code>
    <p>
        Remember that in the third method, images placed in the `<code><b>public</b></code>` folder are treated as
        static assets, and you reference them without specifying the folder structure beyond the
        `<code><b>public</b></code>` directory.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What would happen if we do <code>console.log(useState())</code> ?</h3>
    <p>
        If you call `<code><b>console.log(useState())</b></code>`, it would show an array with two elements in the
        browser's console. The first element of the array would be the current state value, and the second element would
        be a function that you can use to update that state.
        <br>
        Here's an example of what the output might look like in the console:
        <code><b><pre>[initialStateValue, function]</pre></b></code>

        Let's break down what each part means:
        <br>
        - `<code><b>initialStateValue</b></code>`: This is the initial value you provide when you call the
        `<code><b>useState()</b></code>` function. It's the current value of the state. If you didn't pass any initial
        value, it would be `<code><b>undefined</b></code>` or whatever you set as the default.
        <br>
        - `<code><b>function</b></code>`: This is the updater function that you can use to change the state's value.
        When you call this function and provide a new value, React will re-render the component with the new state
        value.
        <br>
        For example, if you initially called `<code><b>useState('Hello')</b></code>`, the output of
        `<code><b>console.log(useState())</b></code>` might look like this:
        <code><pre><b>["Hello", function]</b></pre></code>
        Keep in mind that you usually don't call `<code><b>useState()</b></code>` directly like this. Instead, you use
        it inside a functional component and use destructuring to extract the state value and updater function
        separately:
        <br>
        <code><pre><b>const [stateValue, setStateValue] = useState(initialState);</b></pre></code>
        This helps you work with the state more conveniently and clearly in your component.
    </p>

    <p>It will get called everytime we are updating the ui i.e. any change in state.</p>

    <h3>What is SPA?</h3>
    <p>
        A Single Page Application (SPA) is a type of web application that interacts with the user by dynamically
        rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server. In simple terms the whole
        application is just one pagae and no page gets refreshed everytime we navigate.

    <h3>Why do we use <code>componentWillUnmount</code>? Show with example.</h3>
    <p>
        We use it to clear the state or to stop the function of that component when we navigate to another component.
        <br><br> Below is the code eg.

    componentWillUnmount() {
        clearInterval(this.timer);
    }</pre>

        In the above eg. if we don't use <code>`<b>componentWillUnmount</b>`</code> the

    <h3>(Research) Why do we use <code><b>super(props)</b></code> in constructor?</h3>
    <p>
        In React class components, the `<code><b>super(props)</b></code>` call is used within the constructor to
        initialize the parent class's constructor and pass the <code><b>`props`</b></code> object to it. This is
        necessary because when you create a class that extends another class (in this case, your React component class
        extending <code><b>`React.Component`</b></code>), you need to make sure that the base class's constructor is
        called before you can access any properties or methods defined in that base class.
        <br><br>
        Here's a breakdown of why `<code><b>super(props)</b></code>` is used:
        <br><br>
        1. <b>Inheritance</b>: React class components are usually defined by extending the
        <code><b>`React.Component`</b></code> class or one of its subclasses. When you create a subclass, you're
        essentially inheriting the properties and methods of the parent class.
        <br><br>
        2. <b>Constructor</b> The <code><b>`constructor`</b></code> is a special method that's executed when an instance
        of a class is created. It's used to initialize the object's properties and perform setup tasks.
        <br><br>
        3. <b>Super Constructor</b>: When you extend a class, your subclass can have its own constructor. However,
        before you can use <code><b>`this`</b></code> in your subclass's constructor, you need to call the constructor
        of the parent class (the base class). This is where `<code><b>super(props)</b></code>` comes in.
        <br><br>
        - <code><b>`super()`</b></code>: Calling <code><b>`super()`</b></code> without any arguments will invoke the
        constructor of the parent class with no arguments. If the parent class's constructor requires arguments (like
        <code><b>`props`</b></code> in this case), this will result in an error.
        <br><br>
        - `<code><b>super(props)</b></code>`: By passing <code><b>`props`</b></code> to <code><b>`super()`</b></code>,
        you're essentially calling the constructor of the parent class (e.g., <code><b>`React.Component`</b></code>)
        with the <code><b>`props`</b></code> object. This allows the parent class to properly initialize its properties
        related to props and sets up the necessary environment for your subclass.
        <br><br>
        Here's an example of how it's used:
        <code>
            <pre>
    class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
        <code><b>super(props)</b></code>; // Call the constructor of the parent class (React.Component) with props
        // Now you can use this.props in your component
        }

        render() {
        // ...
        }
    }</pre>
        </code>

        In modern React, you don't actually need to explicitly call `<code><b>super(props)</b></code>` unless you need
        to access <code><b>`this.props`</b></code> in your constructor. If you don't need to do that, React will
        automatically call <code><b>`super()`</b></code> for you behind the scenes.

        Keep in mind that React has introduced function components with hooks as a more modern way of building
        components, and class components are becoming less common in newer React codebases.

    <h3>(Research) Why can't we have the callback function of useEffect async?</h3>
    <p>
        The callback function of <code><b>`useEffect`</b></code> cannot be declared as <code><b>`async`</b></code>
        because <code><b>`useEffect`</b></code> expects the callback to
        either return nothing or a cleanup function. If the callback is declared as <code><b>`async`</b></code>, it
        implicitly returns a
        <code><b>`Promise`</b></code>, which is not compatible with the expected return types.
        <br><br>
        Example:
        <br>
        <code>
                <pre>
        // This is incorrect and will lead to unexpected behavior
        useEffect(async () => {
            const data = await fetchData(); // fetchData returns a Promise
            setData(data);
        }, []);</pre>
            </code>

        In this example, the <code><b>`useEffect`</b></code> callback is declared as <code><b>`async`</b></code>, and
        it's using <code><b>`await`</b></code> inside it. However,
        <code><b>`useEffect`</b></code> doesn't handle Promises returned by the async callback as expected, and it may
        lead to issues like
        delayed updates or memory leaks.
        <br>
        To work with asynchronous operations inside <code><b>`useEffect`</b></code>, you should call an async function
        inside the callback:
        <code>
                <pre>
        useEffect(() => {
            const fetchDataAsync = async () => {
                const data = await fetchData();
                setData(data);
            };
    
            fetchDataAsync();
        }, []);</pre>
            </code>
        By defining an async function within the <code><b>`useEffect`</b></code> callback and then calling it
        immediately, you ensure proper
        handling of asynchronous operations without breaking the expected behavior of <code><b>`useEffect`</b></code>.

    <h3>When and why do we need <code>`lazy()`</code>?</h3>
    <p>We need <code>`<b>lazy()</b>`</code> when our website becomes very big or has a large no. of components. So we
        don't need each and every component to be loaded at the same time, so we use lazy so that when we switch to that
        component then only that component is loaded / rendered</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is <code><b>Suspense</b></code>?</h3>
    <p><code><b>Suspense</b></code> is a component in react which we use when we have used the <code>`lazy()`</code> to
        import that
        component.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>When do we and why do we need <code><b>Suspense</b></code>?</h3>
    <p>Simply, when we use <code>`<b>lazy()</b>`</code> we need to use <code><b>Suspense</b></code> or first time we go
        to that page the
        page will not load for first time but if go back and revisit that page / component it will now load / render.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        Why we got this error: A component was suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will cause the UI
        to be replaced with a loading indicator. To fix this, updates that suspend should be wrapped with start
        transition? How does <code><b>Suspense</b></code> fix this error?
    </h3>
    <p>Because after using <code>`<b>lazy()</b>`</code> if we directly go to the component without using
        <code><b>Suspense</b></code> then on 1st render the page will not load becasue it is a promise and it takes time
        to load but due to reacts reconcilliation algorithm react continues to load the page but doesn't find anything
        that's why it throws the error, due to this reason we use <code><b>Suspense</b></code>.

    <h3>Explore all the ways of writing CSS.</h3>
    <p>There are different ways of writing CSS such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Just CSS</li>
        <li>SCSS / SASS</li>
        <li>Inline CSS</li>
        <li>Styled Components</li>
        <li>Using Material UI, Ant.design, Bootstrap etc.</li>
        <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>How do we configure Tailwind?</h3>
    <p><code><pre>npx tailwind init</pre></code></p>
    <hr>
    <h3>In tailwind.config.js, what does all the keys mean (content, theme, extend, plugins)?</h3>
    <p>Detailed docs are <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration">here</a>.</p>
    <li>
        The <code>`<b>content</b>`</code> section of your <code>`<b>tailwind.config.js</b>`</code> file is where you
        configure the paths to all of your HTML templates, JavaScript components, and any other source files that
        contain Tailwind class names.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <code>`<b>theme</b>`</code> section of your <code>`<b>tailwind.config.js</b>`</code> file is where you
        define your project's color palette, type scale, fonts, breakpoints, border radius values, and more.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you'd like to preserve the default values for a theme option but also add new values, add your extensions
        under the <code>`<b>extend</b>`</code> key in the <code>`<b>theme</b>`</code> section of your configuration
        file.
        <br>
        For example, if you wanted to add an extra breakpoint but preserve the existing ones, you could extend the
        <code>`<b>screens</b>`</code> property:
    </li>
    <li>
        To get started with your first plugin, import Tailwind's <code>`<b>plugin</b>`</code> function from
        <code>`<b>tailwindcss/plugin</b>`</code>. Then inside your <code>`<b>plugins</b>`</code> array, call the
        imported <code>`<b>plugin</b>`</code> function with an anonymous function as the first argument.

    <h3>Why do we have .postcssrc file?</h3>
    <p>

    <h3>What is lifting the state up?</h3>
    <p>
        It simply means sharing state between components. Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always
        change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass
        it down to them via props. This is known as lifting state up, and it's one of the most common things you will do
        writing React code.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is Context Provider and Context Consumer?</h3>
    <p>
        In plain text the provider is used to create a context that can be consumed. The consumer is used to consume the
        nearest provided context.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>If you don't pass a value to the provider does it take the default value?</h3>
    <p>No, it gives us the warning that the `<code><b>value</b></code>` prop is required.</p>

    <h3>Explain Dispatcher.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Think of a "dispatcher" like a mail delivery person for your app's state. In React, components often need to
            talk to each other and share information. The dispatcher helps with this.
        </li>
        <li>
            Imagine you have different parts of your app (like different rooms) that need to send and receive messages.
            The dispatcher is like the person who takes messages from one room and delivers them to the right places.
        </li>
        <li>
            In your app, when something changes in one part (a component), the dispatcher makes sure that other parts
            (other components) are notified and can update themselves based on the new information.
        </li>
        <li>
            So, in simple terms, the dispatcher helps different parts of your app communicate and stay in sync, just
            like a mail delivery person helping different rooms share important news!
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Explain Reducer.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Imagine a "reducer" as a smart organizer that listens to the messages delivered by the dispatcher and
            decides
            how things should change.
        </li>
        <li>
            In your app, when a component wants to change something (like updating a counter or adding an item), it
            sends a
            message to the reducer. The reducer is like the smart organizer that looks at the message and decides what
            needs
            to be done based on the message's content.
        </li>
        <li>
            It takes the current situation (the state) and the message (action), then figures out the new situation
            (updated
            state). Just like how an organizer takes a messy room and a cleaning plan, and turns it into a clean room.
        </li>
        <li>
            So, in simple terms, a reducer is like an organizer that knows how to handle changes in your app's data and
            keeps everything tidy!
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Explain slice.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A <strong>slice</strong> is a part of your app's state.</li>
        <li>It's like a piece of a puzzle.</li>
        <li>The <strong>reducer</strong> knows how to handle changes in this slice.</li>
        <li>Each slice has its own logic and data.</li>
        <li>It helps keep your app organized and manageable.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Explain Selector.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A <strong>selector</strong> is like a detective for your app's state.</li>
        <li>It helps you get specific information from the big state.</li>
        <li>Just like asking a detective to find a clue in a case file.</li>
        <li><strong>Selectors</strong> make it easy to grab data you need.</li>
        <li>They keep your code organized and efficient.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Explain createSlice and the configuration it takes.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>createSlice</code> creates a <strong>slice</strong> of the Redux store.</li>
        <li>It bundles a <strong>reducer</strong> and <strong>action creators</strong> together.</li>
        <li>Simplifies state management by handling common tasks.</li>
        <li><code>name</code>: A unique name for the slice (string).</li>
        <li><code>initialState</code>: The initial state for the slice (object).</li>
        <li><code>reducers</code>: An object with functions to handle state changes.</li>
        <li><code>extraReducers</code>: Optional, for handling actions from other slices.</li>
        <li>Returns an object with <strong>reducer</strong> and <strong>actions</strong> properties.</li>
