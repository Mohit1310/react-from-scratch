    <h3>Is JSX mandatory for React?</h3>
    <p>
        No, JSX (JavaScript XML) is not mandatory for writing React applications, but it is highly recommended and
        widely used due to its benefits. JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within
        JavaScript, making it easier to describe and visualize the structure of your UI components. <br>While you can
        write React applications using plain JavaScript without JSX, doing so can make your code more verbose, harder to
        read, and less intuitive. JSX simplifies the process of defining UI elements and their interactions with data by
        providing a declarative and expressive syntax.
    </p>
    <p>Here's an example of a simple React component written with and without JSX:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>
                <h4>With JSX:</h4>
            </th>
            <th>
                <h4>Without JSX:</h4>
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tbody>
            <td>
                <code>
                import React from 'react';<br><br>
                const MyComponent = () => {
                    <p class="indentation">return (</p>
                        <p class="indentation1">&lt;div&gt;</p>
                        <p class="indentation1">&lt;h1&gt;Hello, JSX!&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
                        <p class="indentation1">&lt;p&gt;This is a React component with JSX.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
                        <p class="indentation1">&lt;/div&gt;</p>
                    <p class="indentation">);</p>
                };
                <br>
                export default MyComponent;
                </code>
            </td>
            <td>
                <code>
                    import React from 'react';<br><br>
                    const MyComponent = () => {<br>
                    <p class="indentation">return React.createElement('div', null,</p>
                        <p class="indentation">React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, No JSX!'),</p>
                        <p class="indentation">React.createElement('p', null, 'This is a React component without JSX.')</p>
                    <p class="indentation">);</p>
                };
                <br>
                export default MyComponent;
                </code>
            </td>
        </tbody>

    <h3>Is ES6 mandatory for React?</h3>
    <p>
        ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is not mandatory for writing React applications, but it is highly recommended and widely
        used due to the modern JavaScript features and improvements it provides. React itself doesn't require you to use
        ES6, but leveraging ES6 features can significantly enhance your development experience and code quality.
    </p>
    <p>Few Reason's why ES6 is benificial</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Arrow Functions</li>
        <li>Classes</li>
        <li>Template literals</li>
        <li>Destructuring</li>
        <li>Spread and rest operators</li>
        <li>Modules</li>
        <li>Async/Await</li>
        <li>Let and Const</li>
        <li>Default parameters</li>

    <h3>How can I write comments in <code>JSX</code>?</h3>
    <p>As we know if we use "{}" we can write an js code inside brackets we can use "//...." for single line comment and
        "{/*...*/}" for multiline comments.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is <code>&lt;React.Fragment&gt;&lt;/React.Fragment&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;</code> ?</h3>
    <p>
        Both are used to create a component that doesn't render and additional DOM element. React.Fragment is a built in
        component while <code>&lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;</code> is more concise syntax ('fragment shorthand') or empty tag. This
        is available from React 16.2, in React.fragment we can use '<b>key</b>' or other attributes but not in empty
        tag.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Virtual DOM?</h3>
    <p>
        Virtual DOM simple means a representation of actual DOM. This is used in libraries or frameworks such as React
        for UI rendering only rendering that element or let's say a new 'div' is added to your code instead of rendering
        the whole code react only renders the new added code. This process is called <i>reconcilliation</i>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is Reconciliation in react?</h3>
    <p>
        We can also call it as <i>'Preserving and Resetting State'</i><br>
        <b>Defination: </b>The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be
        changed.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is React Fibre?</h3>
    <p>
        It is basically a new and upcoming algorithm/architecture for react's diff algorithm for more we can read <a
            href="https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <h3>Why we need keys in React?</h3>
    <p>
        The main purpose of keys is to help React differentiate and distinguish elements from each other, increasing its
        performance when diffing between the virtual and real DOM.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Can we use index as keys in React?</h3>
    <p>
        We can use them but it is not recommended and mostly we should not use them because that can cause rendering /
        re-rendering
        issue. Detailed article is <a href="https://robinpokorny.com/blog/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern/">here</a>.

    <h3>What is props in React?</h3>
    <p>
        props (properties) in react are simply an arguments to the function. React components use props to communicate
        with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props.
        Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including
        objects, arrays, and functions.

    <h3>What is Config Driven UI?</h3>
    <p>
        For simple terms let's take example of <a href="https://www.swiggy.com/">Swiggy</a>. On the swiggy's website we
        can see a navbar, carousel which has offers and then the body and so on. Now inside the carousel the offers are
        different for every city some may have it some may don't and the data is rendered accordingly. So if a city has
        no offers then directly the body will appear after the navbar and no carousel. This type of rendering is known
        as Config Driven UI.
    </p>
