      <strong>"div>div>h1"</strong>
      will create a div inside another div inside it h1 tag will create

    <h3>Difference between a Library and Framework?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        A library is like a toolbox filled with various tools. Each tool has a
        specific function, like a hammer, a screwdriver, or a wrench. When you
        want to build something, you can take out the tools you need from the
        toolbox and use them individually to create your project. You have the
        freedom to choose which tools to use and how to use them, allowing you
        to build things your own way.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, a framework is like a blueprint or a set of
        guidelines for building something specific, like a house. It provides
        you with a structured plan, telling you what materials to use, where to
        put each part, and how to assemble everything together. It's like
        following a step-by-step instruction manual that ensures all the pieces
        fit together perfectly. The framework helps you build the project more
        efficiently and ensures consistency, but it might limit some of your
        creative freedom compared to using a toolbox full of various tools.
      </p>

    <h3>What is CDN and why do we use it?</h3>
    <p>
      It is a content delivery network. We use it for faster load times,
      scalability, cost savings, etc. It is a powerful tool to accelerate
      website loading times and experience
    </p>

    <h3>Why React is known as React?</h3>
    <p>
      React is known as "React" because its name comes from its core concept of
      "reacting" to changes in data and updating the user interface accordingly.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>What is crossorigin in script tag?</h3>
    <p>
      The `crossorigin` attribute in the script tag allows loading scripts from
      different domains securely. It prevents browser security issues when
      fetching scripts from external sources by enforcing proper permissions.
